# Python-DNS-Server-Project
For this project I was given a list of DNS server IPs and their providers. I used Python to build a way to put that information together, similar to a phone book for quick and easy reference.
I used a for loop to create a dictionary mapping the provider names to their respective IPs.
I then used a for loop to create a list of dictionaries with the associated information.
Next, I use a for loop to update my dictionary from part 1 with the new IPs.
Lastly, I use nested for loops to update the list from part 2 with a 'secondary_server' key.
